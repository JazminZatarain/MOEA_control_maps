# MOEA_control_maps
Control map plots for MOEA diagnostics in python.

This repository contains python code to average metrics for different candidate MOEA parameterizations across multiple seeds, handling different vector sizes from runtime output in average_metrics.py which is called by make_control_map.py to generate a control map using Borg output for the Lake problem. The sample parameters and data_metrics are also provided.
